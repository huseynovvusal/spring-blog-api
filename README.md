## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 24
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- Gradle

### 🚦 Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spring-blog-api
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```
3. Run Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
4. Use the API service on:
   ```
   http://localhost:8082/api/v1/
   ```

### ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `src/main/resources/application.yml` to configure database and other settings.

## 📖 API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI.  
**Most requests require an `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header.**

**`http://localhost:8082/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html#/`**

#### Notes

- Duplicate prevention is enforced by a unique database constraint `(user_id, blog_id)` and idempotent service logic.
- The current user is resolved from the JWT claim `uid`.
- Error codes:
  - `401 Unauthorized` — missing/expired token
  - `404 Not Found` — blog does not exist

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting & Circuit Breaker

This API implements robust rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns to protect against abuse and service failures:

### Rate Limiting

- **Default API endpoints**: 20 requests/60 seconds
- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests/60 seconds

### Circuit Breaker

- Automatic database failure detection
- Service degradation during outages
- Graceful error responses (503 Service Unavailable)
